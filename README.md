# Weather-Forecasting-Application
Developed a dynamic web application using Python and Flask framework to provide real-time weather forecast for any city around the world. Integrated with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data and display it to users in a user-friendly interface. Features like city search functionality, temperature unit conversion, and error handling for invalid inputs were implemented. Used HTML/CSS for frontend development to enhance user experience. Deployed the application locally for testing and debugging. This project demonstrates proficiency in API integration, web development.
